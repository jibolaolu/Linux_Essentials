1] create a file called script1.sh with the following entry


#!/bin/sh
# script checks if parameter supplied  directory or not
if [ -d $1 ]
  then
     echo "$1 is a directory"
fi

#==================================

Now try the script by executing ' sh script1.sh /tmp'. The test with other directoies such /opt /var etc


2] Now extend the script to test if parameter is a file or directory and it should say what it is

3] Extend the script to list the directory content if it detects the parameter is a directory

4] add the script location to your system PATH so it can be called or executed from anywhere.

5] Ping me if you have need more exercise.
